# Mini Project Manager

Full-stack application for managing projects and tasks, featuring:

- User authentication (JWT)
- Project and task management per user
- Persistent storage using SQLite
- Frontend built with React (via Vite)
- ASP.NET Core Web API backend

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React** â€“ Modern UI library for component-based development
- **TypeScript** â€“ Type safety and developer productivity
- **Vite** â€“ Fast build tool and dev server for React (alternative to CRA)

> **Why Vite?**  
> We used Vite as the development tool for React because it's significantly faster than Create React App (CRA) and simplifies configuration.  
> **Vite doesn't replace React** â€“ it just makes React development faster and smoother.

### Backend
- **ASP.NET Core (C#)** â€“ RESTful Web API
- **Entity Framework Core** â€“ ORM for database access
- **JWT Authentication** â€“ Secure token-based authentication
- **SQLite** â€“ Lightweight embedded database

---

## Setup Instructions

### Backend
-cd backend
-dotnet restore
-dotnet run

By default, runs on: http://localhost:5000

**Note:** Default JWT secret is hardcoded for demo purposes. In production, store it securely (e.g., via environment variables).



### Fronted
-cd frontend
-npm install
-npm run dev

By default, runs on: http://localhost:3000


## Authentication

Registration and login return a JWT token.

The token is stored in localStorage and included in Authorization headers for protected routes.

CORS is configured to allow requests from the frontend (http://localhost:3000).



## Features

Register & Login

Create/update/delete projects

Add tasks per project

Toggle task completion

Form validation and error handling

Store and reuse JWT for authenticated requests

Loading indicators and user feedback

Mobile-friendly design


## Environment Variables
